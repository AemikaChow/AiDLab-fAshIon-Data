🖤 **Brief Intro**

A dataset with 3567 paired images, that is, real photos and their corresponding fashion illustration for implementation. The source of the real photo is from catwalk images of various high-fashion brands such as LOEWE, GUCCI, and CHANEL. The ready-to-wear from the “Big Four,” that is, New York, London, Milan, and Paris fashion weeks, would have more design attributes and details to be generated than outfits in our daily life. The illustrations created by different professional fashion illustrators are collected from the Internet.
