üñ§ **Brief Intro**

We introduce \textbf{A100} (Aesthetic 100) to assess the aesthetic ability of the fashion compatibility models from the overall performance and characteristic performance.
A100 has several desirable characteristics: 1. \textbf{Completeness}. It covers all types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system through two tests, namely \textbf{LAT} (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and \textbf{AAT} (Academicism Aesthetic Test);
2. \textbf{Reliability}. It is training data agnostic and consistent with major indicators. It provides a fair and objective judgment for model comparison.
3. \textbf{Explainability}. Better than all previous indicators, the A100 further identifies essential characteristics of fashion aesthetics, thus showing the model's performance on more fine-grained dimensions, such as Color, Balance, Material, etc.
