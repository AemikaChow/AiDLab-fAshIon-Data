üñ§ **Brief Intro**

We introduce **A100** (Aesthetic 100) to assess the aesthetic ability of the fashion compatibility models from the overall performance and characteristic performance.
A100 has several desirable characteristics: 1. Completeness. It covers all types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system through two tests, namely LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test);
2. Reliability. It is training data agnostic and consistent with major indicators. It provides a fair and objective judgment for model comparison.
3. Explainability. Better than all previous indicators, the A100 further identifies essential characteristics of fashion aesthetics, thus showing the model's performance on more fine-grained dimensions, such as Color, Balance, Material, etc.

Please cite the following reference paper when this dataset is used in any academic and research reports.
