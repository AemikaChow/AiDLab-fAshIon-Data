üñ§ **Brief Intro**

This is a outfit dataset. The orginal source of outfits are collected from [PolyVore](https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset) and [FashionVC](https://github.com/SDU-MIMA/SHDCH). Different from the previous outfit datasets, we annotated the outfit with evaluation labels as Good, Normal, and Bad. Additionally, we labeled the attributes of all the fashion items.

This means that the EVALUATION3 dataset contains the evaluation labels, attributes labels of each fashion items (including Top(U), bottom(B), bag(G), and shoes(S)). We summary the details of EVALUATION3 in the following Table:

| Numbers  | Outfits | Shoes | Bags | Attributes of Top |   Attributes of Bottom | Attributes of Bag | Attributes of Shoes |
|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
