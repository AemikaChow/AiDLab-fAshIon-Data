🖤 **Brief Intro**

This is a outfit dataset. The orginal source of outfits are collected from [PolyVore](https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset). Different from the previous outfit datasets, we annotated the outfit with evaluation labels as Good, Normal, and Bad. Additionally, we labeled the attributes of all the fashion items.
